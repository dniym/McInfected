{"name":"Mcinfected","tagline":"MW3 Infected for Minecraft","body":"# Welcome to Infected's Wiki.\r\n\r\nThis will hopefully help you figure out how to use Infected as fully as possible!\r\nInfected was a plugin I started making not long after MW3 introduced Infected, originally It was meant to be a \"How much java do I actually know\" but slowly it turned into an actual project.\r\n\r\n## What is \"Infected\"? \r\n\r\nInfected is a popular game mode from Call of Duty's Modern Warfare 3. This plugin tries its' best to replicate that gamemode and turn it into a Minecraft minigame. The objective of this game for humans is to simply outlast and fight the zombies. But you only have one life. Once you get bitten, then you turn into a zombie and are forced to infect the ones who were once your allies and friends. Humans. If you happen to get caught by the horde, your objective as a zombie is to infect all the humans before the timer is up. \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Saves inventory, armor, exp, levels and the player's last known spot\r\n* Auto-starts when the required amount of players join the lobby\r\n* Ability to vote for the map you want to play\r\n* Multiple spawns for arenas\r\n* Score & points system\r\n* Shop - spend your points to buy new items\r\n* Grenades and Classes\r\n* Non Spout GUI for menus\r\n* DisguiseCraft support\r\n* iDisguise Support\r\n* LibsDisguise support\r\n* Vault Support\r\n* Factions Support\r\n* mcMMO Support\r\n* CrackShot Support\r\n* Uses the new scoreboard feature\r\n* Tracks kills/deaths/killstreaks and playing time\r\n* Rewards for winning(Last human alive)\r\n* Grenades (can be customized to your liking)\r\n* Define classes for players to use\r\n* Use your economy instead of points\r\n* Signs can be used for commands/showing game info \r\n* Optional addons\r\n\r\n## Addons\r\nInfected does have the ability for addons to be created by devs, and to start it off i have created two. The first addon is Ranks, this addon allows for ranks to be added to Infected, and each rank can have default classes, and additional permissons granted to the player well in game. The second addon is for anyone who has a Dedicated Infected Server, in other words it has a force join, no longer needs /Infected before commands, and prevents leaving, perfect for a server devoted to only Infected.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to enhance your gameplay experience, there are currently a few plugin addons available for Infected.\r\n\r\n###Disguises\r\nThe first few are for Disguises, but for those you need plugins such as DisguiseCraft, LibsDisguises or iDisguise. These plugins have the ability to disguise infected players as actual zombies! If you're using disguises please be sure to install the latest and greatest ProtocolLib. To use Disguise Support Just enable it in the config\r\n\r\n###Vault\r\nNext would be Vault. With this you can get Infected to use your economy. Just enable it in the config for points to be given as cash, if you want to use vault for shops, just put a '$' in front of the price.\r\n###mcMMO\r\nAnd we all know how awesome mcMMO is, but it can get annoying when playing a pvp minigame, so I have included it as an addon, and with this as an addon, it'll ignore alll the bonus damage, thats right, no more hitting big well other guys are hitting small, this way the pvp is 100% fair\r\n###Factions\r\nFactions was also included in this, A lot people have already experienced how awesome Factions is, so to help it out, i have added Factions support, this will allow allies and fellow faction members to attack each other regardless of where the game is(Wilderness, Claimed Land, Wilderness)\r\n###CrackShot\r\nAnd finally we have CrackShot, now this is an awesome plugin that allows for guns without needing spout. If you want to give guns in classes, or allow players to buy them through a shop, check out this page in the CrackShots wiki.\r\nSupport\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nCheck out my website: http://www.SniperzCiinema.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
