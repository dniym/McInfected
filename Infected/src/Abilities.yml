# Infected's Item Codes  -----   ItemID:DamageValue,Amount-EnchantmentID@EnchantmentLevel-EnchantmentID@EnchantmentLevel%Item_Name
# This code HAS to be used in the order shown, in other words no saying the amount of the item you want, then saying the damage value
# #
# Chances for players to have an ability
# Chances work like this:
# Chance to be a regular is 100, and chance for everything else is 20-30
# All together its 215
# So if the random is <101 theyll be a regular zombie
# If its >100 and <131 they'll be a tank zombie
# If its >130 and <161 they'll be a Runner zombie
# If its >160 and <181 they'll be a Ghost zombie
# And so on...
